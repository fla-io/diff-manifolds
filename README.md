# diff-manifolds
Differentiable Manifolds lecture notes, LMU WS 19.

These notes are neither complete nor accurate.

Missing parts:
1) Proof of Zig-zag lemma,
2) Last lecture (applications of Hodge operator),
3) Probably something I forgot

Last changes:

- typo corrected from "Notations and conventions" to "Topology" sections. Some typos corrected in the rest of the document.
- definition of algebraic field 3.12 corrected (def. of unitary ring changed).

13-03-20:
- remark 17.5 about the definitions of a submanifold of R^n was added

10-03-2020:
- def. 10.17 of pushforward updated

09-03-2020:
- Figures of vector fields added,
- figure of boundary added in the definition of point on the boundary of a manifold
- def. of embeddings added (topological embeddings, smooth immersion, smooth submersion)
- def. of cochain map updated
- remark about topological invariants added
- def. of path-connected space added.
